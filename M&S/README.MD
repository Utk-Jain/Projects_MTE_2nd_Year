# HOTEL MANAGEMENT & SIMULATION SYSTEM
# An application that simulates real world queue handling in a hotel together with a system for providing management functions.

* Developed a simulation model to demonstrate efficient handling of incoming orders for a hotel.
* It demonstrates how to handle queues for delivery orders as well as for orders on the counter.
* * The project generates random numbers (arrival and departure times) for the calculation of the simulation table.
* In addition to simulating real-world queue handlings in a hotel, the software also provides management functionality.
* * The Management functionality ensures the proper flow of work at the hotel.
* * It also sreves the data of hotel staff and other things that are needed at the hotel
* Used concepts of OOP and File Handling in C++ as well as Modelling and Simulation concepts.
* Feel Free to clone this repository on your local machine, you just need a complier to execute the code.
